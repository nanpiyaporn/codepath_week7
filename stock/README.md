## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
I was ok throw the Lab project, then I tried to adapt the lab to my project. It kept me in error. 
To be able to submit this project I have to compile Lab with my stock market. Therefore, no zero score.

I will have time after the final exam I will come back to fix my stock part.
